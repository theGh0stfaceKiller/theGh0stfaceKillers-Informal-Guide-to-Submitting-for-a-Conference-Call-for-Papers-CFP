## Introduction

**"The future belongs to those who prepare for it today." - Malcom X**

Over the past few years, I’ve submitted talk proposals to a wide range of cybersecurity conferences—everything from DEF CON to smaller, local events like BSides. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the process can be both exciting and frustrating. Imagine getting a really awesome gift you have wanted but from a annoying relative. 

I genuinely believe that giving back to the community—whether through talks, workshops, or just sharing knowledge—benefits not only the community but also you as a speaker. It helps refine your ideas, grows your professional network, and even opens doors to new opportunities. I have had all three happen from giving conference talks and workshops. 

Also, whenever I’m out presenting at these conferences, I get the chance to meet incredible people with amazing ideas—many of which would make fantastic talks or workshops. This guide is dedicated to them, to help break down the conference Call for Papers (CFP) process and give them the knowledge and confidence to submit their own proposals. 

The goal of this article is to walk you through my experiences with submitting to conference CFPs. We’ll start by breaking down the CFP process, then dive into what makes a strong submission, including details on your abstract, timestamps, and structuring your talk effectively. From there, I’ll cover the different platforms used for CFP submissions, such as Google Forms and Sessionize.

Then, we’ll get into something every speaker faces: Rejection. I’ll share some personal experiences and tips on how to handle it constructively. Finally, I’ll wrap up with a CFP Abstract and Talk Outline Template that you can use for your own submissions.

Whether you’re submitting for the first time or just looking to refine your process, I hope this guide helps you navigate the CFP world with a little more swagger. 

Let’s get it!

## Understanding the Conference CFP Process

First up—what exactly is a **Call for Papers (CFP)?** Simply put, a CFP is when a conference reaches out to the public and invites submissions for talk ideas, usually centered around a specific theme. This is your chance to pitch a topic, share your expertise, and (hopefully) land a speaking slot.  

When submitting a proposal, you’ll typically need to provide the following:

- **Abstract** – A high-level summary of your talk. This should include key points, why the topic matters, and who the ideal audience is.
- **Talk Title** – Self-explanatory, but make sure it’s relevant, engaging, and gives a clear idea of your talk’s focus.
- **Talk Outline** – Think of this as the skeleton bones of your presentation. It should cover the main points and supporting topics you’ll discuss.
- **Speaker Bio** – A short write-up about you: who you are, what you do, and maybe a little about your interests. Keep it professional but human—organizers like to know the person behind the talk.
- **Expected Duration** – How long is your talk? I personally like to include this in the outline itself, breaking down each section by time. (More on that in the next section.)

**Note:** Always check the conference’s official website for specific CFP submission guidelines. Some conferences, like DEF CON and its various Villages, may require additional details such as prior speaking experience, demo requirements, or even video submissions. Each event has its own process, so don’t assume this is a one-size-fits-all ordeal. 

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s dive into the finer details in Detailing the Important Aspects of a CFP Submission.

## Detailing the Important Aspects of a CFP Submission

### Writing an Effective Abstract

When crafting an abstract, your focus should be on two key elements: clarity and impact. Your abstract should answer two critical questions:

- What is your talk about? (Give a clear, high-level explanation.)
- Why does it matter? (Explain its relevance and importance to the audience.)

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Ignoring the conference theme – Make sure your topic aligns with the overall theme of the event. If the CFP specifically asks for topics on emerging threats, don’t submit a talk about crypto.  
- Being too vague – If the conference organizers can’t figure out what your talk is really about, they’re likely to pass on it.  
- Going too deep, too soon – This isn’t the place to drop technical deep dives or complex jargon. Save that for the actual talk.   Slow it down killer...

Here's an example of an abstract about the security pitfalls with using Active Directory:

```
This presentation dives into the critical issues of common network misconfigurations in large organizations, as highlighted by a joint cybersecurity advisory from the NSA and CISA. Focusing specifically on Microsoft Active Directory (AD), this talk explores the top 10 security vulnerabilities that cyber actors often exploit. Participants will gain a clear understanding of how these misconfigurations impact AD environments and learn best practices for mitigating them. This session is essential for IT professionals and security administrators looking to strengthen their defenses against sophisticated threats.  
```

**Pro Tip:** Keep it concise, avoid personal details, and make it clear why attendees (and conference organizers) should care.

Next up, let’s break down how to craft an effective outline—arguably one of the most important parts of your CFP submission.

### Providing an Outline with details

When submitting your talk outline, it’s crucial to provide a clear timeline and a bit of detail on what you’ll be covering. Conference organizers operate on strict schedules to accommodate multiple speakers and events, so they need to ensure that talks stay within their allotted time.

That said, there’s usually some "wiggle room" in terms of content—new exciting and cool ideas often emerge while developing your talk or workshop. This has happened to me on every talk or workshop I have done. Just make sure you stick to your original timeline and remain respectful of the agreed duration.

#### **How to Structure Your Outline Effectively**

- State the total duration of your talk (e.g., 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 55 minutes). This shows that you understand the timing requirements.
- Break down key sections and include timestamps to show how you’ll allocate time across your talk (e.g., Introduction, Core Content, Q&A). A well-structured outline gives organizers  those "warm fuzzies" that you’re disciplined and prepared.
- Keep it concise but informative—highlight major topics while showing logical flow.

##### Example: Active Directory Security Talk (55 Minutes)

Here’s a snippet from a previous Active Directory Security talk I gave:

```
**Outline/Timeline (55 mins)**  
  
Introduction - (5 minutes)  
- Welcome and session overview  
- Highlight the importance of securing Active Directory  
- Brief overview of the NSA and CISA advisory  

1. Default Configurations of Software and Applications - (4 minutes)  
- Risks of default settings in AD  
- Custom configurations for enhanced security  
```

Next, let’s go over the different platforms you’ll use to submit your CFP and how to use them effectively. 


-  **Pro Tip:** My fellow colleague and hacker pal, Bailey Marshall, recommends that if a CFP form has a section like _“What else would you like us to know?”_ or _“Any final thoughts?”_—**ALWAYS fill it out!** Most people leave it blank, but this is a **free space** to reinforce why your talk matters. Use it to:

	-  **Highlight why your talk is unique** (_"This talk is based on real-world case studies from my experience in blah, blah, blah."_)  
	-  **Showcase prior speaking experience** (_"I’ve presented a version of this at Basket Weaving 2025 conference, and it was well received."_)  
	-  **Provide extra resources** (_"I have a demo and hands-on lab materials ready if needed."_)

Think of it as **the bonus level**—it won’t guarantee an acceptance, but **it can give you an edge!**
## Different Platforms for CFP Submissions

Over the years, different conferences have used a variety of platforms for their CFP submission process. Some are more streamlined than others, but my key takeaway is: always follow the specific instructions provided by the conference to avoid unnecessary silly mistakes.

Here are some of the most common methods I’ve encountered:
#### **Google Forms**

Google Forms is a popular choice for smaller, local conferences. It’s free (who doesn't love free?), easy to set up, and gets the job done. However, as a speaker, there are a few things to keep in mind when submitting a talk:

- Read through the entire form first. Each conference asks for different details, and some may require extra information you didn’t expect.
- Watch out for character limits. Some forms impose strict limits on abstracts or bios, so you may need to do some “wordsmithing” to keep things concise while still getting your message across.
- Double-check that formatting.  Google Forms doesn’t always handle special characters well, make sure your submission looks "so fresh and so clean" before hitting send.

#### **Sessionize**

Sessionize (https://sessionize.com/) has become a widely used platform for CFPs, and I say this for good reason. Described as a "smart way to do Call for Papers, Schedule, and Speaker Management"—their words, not mine.  But as someone who helps run the CFP process for my local BSides, I have to say, I really appreciate what they offer.

- This is the "One-stop shop for CFPs." The platform allows organizers to manage submissions, schedule talks, and notify both accepted and rejected speakers all in one place. 
- Great for speakers who as I say "want to take that talk on tour".  One of the best features of Sessionize is that once your speaker profile is set up, you can easily submit the same talk to multiple conferences.  I have had great success with this feature. Apply to as many relevant events as possible—you’d be surprised how many cool conferences will pick up your talk.

#### **Other CFP Submission Methods**

Not every conference uses a structured platform. Some still rely on:

- Direct email submissions – Some conferences like DEF CON outline their requirements on their website and ask for submissions via email. Just be sure to format your email professionally and follow all their guidelines.
- Custom portals – Larger conferences, some DEF CON Villages and BSides conferences have their own CFP portals or specific email submission processes. Pay close attention to their instructions, as they sometimes require additional details like past speaking experience, demo videos, or references.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re unclear about something, don’t hesitate to reach out to the conference organizers. Most are very helpful and will clarify any submission questions you have.

Now, let’s talk about something *EVERY* speaker faces:  Rejection.

## Dealing with Rejection

So, you’ve put in the blood, sweat and tears, sent in your CFP submission, and now you play the waiting game. Then, the email or notification arrives—and, just like any guarantee in life like death and taxes (as an old military supervisor of mine used to say), rejection happens.

Take a deep breath. One more.  Ok, now, let’s put things into perspective...

#### Rejection Is Just Part of the Process

Every speaker—yes, every speaker, including myself—gets their talks rejected at some point. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been turned down. And guess what? It’s not personal.

Your talk could be cool as Miles Davis himself, but conference organizers receive an overwhelming number of submissions. Sometimes, your talk doesn’t fit their current theme. Other times, they simply have too many great submissions and tough choices to make. It happens, time to move forward...

#### Learn and Grow from Rejection

The best thing you can do? Ask for feedback.

Some conferences and villages are great about this, while others (taking off my rose tinted glasses)... not so much. Some will say, _"We received too many submissions and can't provide individual feedback."_ Personally, I call "shenanigans"! I have had major conferences take the time to give thoughtful feedback, same goes with smaller ones too.  Just give them the ample time to provide the feedback.  This usually occurs a little while after they have selected their speakers.

Pro Tip: If a conference consistently refuses to provide constructive feedback, consider whether it’s worth submitting to them again. Organizers who genuinely want good talks will help speakers improve.  
 
When you do get feedback, ask yourself:

-  How can I improve my abstract and submission?
-  Did my talk align with the conference theme?
-  Did I present my outline clearly, with timestamps and logical flow?
-  Was my topic too niche, or not compelling enough for their audience?

Take the insights you get and use them to refine your submission for future opportunities.  No retreat, no surrender!

Now, let’s set you up for success! Here’s a solid CFP Abstract and Talk Outline Template to help you crush your next submission:

## CFP Abstract and Talk Outline Template

Below are two templates to help you structure your abstract and talk outline. If you apply the insights from the "Detailing the Important Aspects of a CFP Submission" section, I promise you’ll greatly increase your chances of getting selected.

#### **Abstract Template**

Your abstract should be clear, engaging, and to the point. Here’s a simple structure to follow:

```
Title: [Your Talk Title Here]

Abstract:  
In this talk, we will cover [topic] and explore [key points]. We aim to [purpose or goal of your presentation]. Attendees will leave with [main takeaway].  
```

**Pro Tip:** Make sure your abstract explains what the talk is about and why it matters. Keep it concise—this is your elevator pitch to the conference organizers!

---

#### **Talk Outline Template**

Your outline should provide a clear structure for your talk and show organizers that you’ve thought through the timing.

```
2. Introduction (5 min)  
   - Brief overview of the topic  
   - Key reasons why this topic matters  

3. First Content Section (20 min)  
   - Point 1: [Details]  
   - Point 2: [Details]  
   - Point 3: [Details]  

4. Second Content Section (15 min)  
   - Point 1: [Details]  
   - Point 2: [Details]  
   - Point 3: [Details]  

5. Q&A (5 min)  
   - Address key questions from the audience  
```

- Break down your content with timestamps. This helps organizers see that your talk fits within the allotted time.  
- Pull a Thanos and keep your sections balanced. If your talk is 30 minutes long, don’t spend 20 minutes on the intro!  
- Plan for audience engagement. Q&A time is essential—factor it in. 

By following these templates, you’ll submit a polished, well-structured proposal that conference organizers can easily evaluate. Now go forth and get those CFPs accepted!

## Conclusion

Submitting a CFP can feel like a daunting process and seem as fun as shoveling snow, but with the right approach, it becomes a valuable learning experience—whether you get accepted or not. By crafting a clear and compelling abstract, structuring your talk with a solid outline, and following each conference’s specific guidelines, you significantly improve your chances of getting selected.

Just remember and realize rejection is part of the journey, but it’s not the end of the road. Every submission helps you refine your ideas, improves on your presentation skills, and gets you closer to landing that speaker slot. Keep learning, keep iterating, and don’t be afraid to “take your talk on tour” by submitting it to multiple conferences.  

At the end of the day, the cybersecurity community thrives on shared knowledge. If you have insights, experiences, or techniques that can help others—put yourself out there. The stage is waiting for you.
